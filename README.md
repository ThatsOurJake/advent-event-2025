# Advent Event 2025

This readme contains all you might want to know about this game event.

## The concept
This years event main aim is to promote teamwork in which each player gets separated into one of the three elf factions, red, green, blue. The players are then to work together to load presents onto the sleigh through four actions
- Mining ore
- Forging ore
- Wrapping gifts
- Loading onto the sleigh
The catch is each day there are only 3 action points so a player has to choose which tasks they want to spend these points on, is it mine 3 ore or wrap 2 presents and forge one ore into a gift mound. The second catch is, what is produced today does not become available until the next day of the event.

The event is to also run for a short length of time to try and keep engagement high.

## The implementation
With the initial concept there were a few problems I needed to try circumvent:
- Concurrency of players
- People losing interest
